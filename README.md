JOB BOARD SYSTEM
================

To get started, clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markmuthii/jobboard
```

Then, create the global file

```bash
cd jobboard/config && cp sample.global.php global.php
```

Open the project in your text editor of choice and set the right settings in the global.php file you just created.

If you like (or don't like) the project, then be sure to tell me so on Twitter [@muthiimm](https://twitter.com/Mark_Muthii) or Instagram [@markmuthii](https://instagram.com/markmuthii).
