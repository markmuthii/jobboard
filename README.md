# JOB BOARD SYSTEM

## UPDATE:

This is a very old and insecure system whose code I wrote in my early days of learning PHP. Not sure how you've stumbled upon it, but here you are. Do not use the code contained herein, unless it is for learning purposes, as it is vulnerable to just about all web exploits known :).

I am just leaving it here as a museum of sorts.

End update.

<hr>

To get started, clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markmuthii/jobboard
```

Then, create the global file

```bash
cd jobboard/config && cp sample.global.php global.php
```

Open the project in your text editor of choice and set the right settings in the global.php file you just created.

If you like (or don't like) the project, then be sure to tell me so on Twitter [@Mark_Muthii](https://twitter.com/Mark_Muthii) or Instagram [@markmuthii](https://instagram.com/markmuthii).
